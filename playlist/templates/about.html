                            <h4>PROBLEM SUMMARY</h4>
                            <p>Resonate administrators and community members require a user centric site that allows for members to diversify their playlist generating through a recommendation tool to find the most popular tracks for each tag. The purpose of this project is to create a site that will allow users to build and publish playlists and update the metadata to classify the playlist to the Resonate community. This can be used as a metric to sell advertisement space and promote playlist popularity.</p>
                            <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
                            <p>The solution proposed here is to enhance the experience of a Resonate user by allowing users to search for the most popular tracks for each tag/genre. This search algorithm helps users to discover new songs and improve the variety in a customized playlist. Users will be able to build a custom playlist using these recommendations tailored towards their taste in similar tracks. </p>
